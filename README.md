# autohighnoon v 0.1.0

#### Context

This twitter bot was inspired by the cowboy Jesse McCree, from the popular FPS Overwatch. Specifically, the character's signature voice line [It's high noon... draw!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJqkRaymjc) Inspired by this, the bot checks different timezones, and specifically areas within these timezones, every hour on the hours, and tweets out an alert of where in the world it is currently high noon.

#### Local Developement

**1.** Populate config.js with your twitter account's credentials, as well as a personal handle for the bot to report errors to (your own twtiter account).

**2.** `npm install` to install dependencies

**3.** `npm start` to launch the bot locally
